The NTP (Network Time Protocol) is used to keep the system clock in sync with a server and it works through the UDP port number 123. The protocol has been designed to compensate the network latencies.

## Install and run the NTP server

Install the NTP server on your distribution. On Debian/*buntu enter

```bash
apt-get install ntp ntpdate
```

while on Red Hat/Fedora

```bash
yum install ntp
```

For a standard configuration there is nothing more to do, the system is working. For extra configurations go to the `ntp.conf` file, the is the configuration file of the `ntpd` daemon.

```bash
vi /etc/ntp.conf
```

The content should be similar to this one (this is from Debian)

```bash
#/etc/ntp.conf, configuration for ntpd

driftfile /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift
statsdir /var/log/ntpstats/

statistics loopstats peerstats clockstats
filegen loopstats file loopstats type day enable
filegen peerstats file peerstats type day enable
filegen clockstats file clockstats type day enable

# You do need to talk to an NTP server or two (or three).
#server ntp.your-provider.example

# pool.ntp.org maps to more than 300 low-stratum NTP servers.
# Your server will pick a different set every time it starts up.
# *** Please consider joining the pool! ***
# *** ***
server 0.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst
server 1.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst
server 2.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst
server 3.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst

# By default, exchange time with everybody, but don't allow configuration.
# See /usr/share/doc/ntp-doc/html/accopt.html for details.
restrict -4 default kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery
restrict -6 default kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery

# Local users may interrogate the ntp server more closely.
restrict 127.0.0.1
restrict ::1

# Clients from this (example!) subnet have unlimited access,
# but only if cryptographically authenticated
#restrict 192.168.123.0 mask 255.255.255.0 notrust

# If you want to provide time to your local subnet, change the next line.
# (Again, the address is an example only.)
#broadcast 192.168.123.255

# If you want to listen to time broadcasts on your local subnet,
# de-comment the next lines. Please do this only if you trust everybody
# on the network!
#disable auth
#broadcastclient
```

There is a list of default servers marked by `server`. The list in this case is the Debian one, but every distribution should have its own. More servers can be added to the list.

There is an option to make the ntp server available _to_ your subnet uncommenting the line

```bash
broadcast 192.168.123.255
```

while uncommenting

```bash
disable auth
broadcastclient
```

allows your daemon to listen for a syncronization coming _from_ your local subnet.

Adding more server to the list increases accuracy, in particular if they are very close to you and therefore are less affected by latency. Try to add servers that are in your country or your ISP's server, if it has one.

## Notes

* **1.** Check the quality of your servers: the `ntpq` command shows are connected and their latency. The jitter value should always be lesser than 100 and the offset delay value different from 0.

   ```bash
   ntpq -p
   ```

* **2.** Firewall: the NTP server listen on the UDP 123 port. Be sure that the port is opened.

## More infos on the NTP system

Refer to man pages for more information of the ntpd daemon.

```bash
man ntpd
man ntp.conf
```

Refer to the NTP.org web site for more information on the NTP protocol.

## Server NTP lists

There are many NTP servers on the net that can be found through a quick search on Google or on the pages of the NTP Pool Project. Here a small list of the most known.

The Debian servers

```bash
server 0.debian.pool.ntp.org
server 1.debian.pool.ntp.org
server 2.debian.pool.ntp.org
server 3.debian.pool.ntp.org
```

The Red Hat/Fedora servers

```bash
server 0.fedora.pool.ntp.org
server 1.fedora.pool.ntp.org
server 2.fedora.pool.ntp.org
```

European servers from the NTP Pool Project

```bash
server 0.europe.pool.ntp.org
server 1.europe.pool.ntp.org
server 2.europe.pool.ntp.org
server 3.europe.pool.ntp.org
```

There is a number of national servers. Their name is the same as the ones before with the national label on the from. For example

```bash
server 0.uk.pool.ntp.org
server 1.it.pool.ntp.org
server 2.de.pool.ntp.org
server 3.fr.pool.ntp.org
```

Choose the closest to you.

Three big lists maintained by NTP.org:

* [General list](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/NTPPoolServers)
* [1st stratum servers](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/StratumOneTimeServers)
* [2nd stratum servers](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/StratumTwoTimeServers)

For italians there are some servers maintained by INRIM (Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica):

```bash
ntp1.inrim.it
ntp2.inrim.it
ntp1.ien.it
ntp2.ien.it
```
