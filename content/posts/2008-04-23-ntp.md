To keep always the Linux clock on time there is a specific protocol. Its name is NTP or Network Time Protocol. The purpose of the NTP is to syncronize the clock with a server and it works through the UDP port number 123. The protocol has been designed to compensate the network latency connecting to many web servers and calculating from the collected data the correct time.

## Install and run the NTP server

Install the NTP server on your distribution. On Debian/*buntu enter

```bash
# apt-get install ntp ntpdate
```

while on Red Hat/Fedora

```bash
# yum install ntp
```

For a standard configuration there is nothing more to do. The system is working. But if you want to change something the place to go is the %codebox%ntp.conf%% file that is the configuration file of the daemon %codebox%ntpd%%.

```bash
# vi /etc/ntp.conf
```

The content should be similar to this one (this is from Debian)

```bash
#/etc/ntp.conf, configuration for ntpd

driftfile /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift
statsdir /var/log/ntpstats/

statistics loopstats peerstats clockstats
filegen loopstats file loopstats type day enable
filegen peerstats file peerstats type day enable
filegen clockstats file clockstats type day enable

# You do need to talk to an NTP server or two (or three).
#server ntp.your-provider.example

# pool.ntp.org maps to more than 300 low-stratum NTP servers.
# Your server will pick a different set every time it starts up.
# *** Please consider joining the pool! ***
# *** ***
server 0.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst
server 1.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst
server 2.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst
server 3.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst

# By default, exchange time with everybody, but don't allow configuration.
# See /usr/share/doc/ntp-doc/html/accopt.html for details.
restrict -4 default kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery
restrict -6 default kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery

# Local users may interrogate the ntp server more closely.
restrict 127.0.0.1
restrict ::1

# Clients from this (example!) subnet have unlimited access,
# but only if cryptographically authenticated
#restrict 192.168.123.0 mask 255.255.255.0 notrust

# If you want to provide time to your local subnet, change the next line.
# (Again, the address is an example only.)
#broadcast 192.168.123.255

# If you want to listen to time broadcasts on your local subnet,
# de-comment the next lines. Please do this only if you trust everybody
# on the network!
#disable auth
#broadcastclient
```

There is a list of default servers. The list in this case is the Debian one, but every distribution should have its own, and in any case you can put in the servers you prefer.

There is an option to make the ntp server available for your subnet uncommenting the line

```bash
broadcast 192.168.123.255
```

while uncommenting

```bash
disable auth
broadcastclient
```

you allow your daemon to listen for a syncronization coming from your local subnet.

Adding more server to the list means more accurate time, in particular if they are very close to you. But don't add too many servers, the band will fill up. Three or four servers are a good balance. Try to add servers that are in your country or your ISP's server, if it have one.

## Notes

* **1.** Check the quality of your servers: using the ntpq command you can see to which servers you are connected and the latency. The jitter value should always be lesser than 100 and the offset delay value different from 0.

   ```bash
   # ntpq -p
   ```

* **2.** Firewall: the NTP server listen on the UDP 123 port. Be sure that the port is opened.

## More infos on the NTP system

As usual there are many other things to know. Refers always to man pages for Linux commands and implementation.

```bash
$ man ntpd
$ man ntp.conf
```

Refers to the NTP.org web site to have more information on the NTP protocol.

## Server NTP lists

There are many NTP servers on the net. A quick search on Google will find many of them or you can visit the page of the NTP Pool Project. Here a small list of the more important/known.

The Debian servers

```bash
server 0.debian.pool.ntp.org
server 1.debian.pool.ntp.org
server 2.debian.pool.ntp.org
server 3.debian.pool.ntp.org
```

The Red Hat/Fedora servers

```bash
server 0.fedora.pool.ntp.org
server 1.fedora.pool.ntp.org
server 2.fedora.pool.ntp.org
```

European servers from the NTP Pool Project

```bash
server 0.europe.pool.ntp.org
server 1.europe.pool.ntp.org
server 2.europe.pool.ntp.org
server 3.europe.pool.ntp.org
```

There is a number of national servers. Their name is the same as the ones before with the national label on the from. For example

```bash
server 0.uk.pool.ntp.org
server 1.it.pool.ntp.org
server 2.de.pool.ntp.org
server 3.fr.pool.ntp.org
```

and so on. Choose the closest to you.

Three big lists maintained by NTP.org:

* [General list](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/NTPPoolServers)
* [1st stratum servers](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/StratumOneTimeServers)
* [2nd stratum servers](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/StratumTwoTimeServers)

For italians there are some servers maintained by INRIM (Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica):

```bash
ntp1.inrim.it
ntp2.inrim.it
ntp1.ien.it
ntp2.ien.it
```
