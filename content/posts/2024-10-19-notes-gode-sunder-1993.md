Paper from D. K. Gode and S. Sunder from 1993.

From the belief, that performance of an economy is the joint result of institutional structure, market, environment, and agent behavior. They try to isolate defect of agent behavior on market performance. They compare the performance of human trader, unconstrained ZI-U traders, and budget constrained ZI-C traders.

Zero Intelligence traders generate random bids or offers, distributed independently, identically, and uniformly over a fixed range of trading prices. The traders have no intelligence, no belief in price formation, they don't seek or maximize profits, don't observe, remember or learn.

In each trading period buyers are endowed with the right to buy units of a commodity and are privately informed of the redemption value of each unit. Seller are endowed with the right to sell units of the commodity and are informed of the cost of each unit. Buyers profit from buying at prices, lower than the retention value, sellers profit from selling and prices higher than the cost.
Buyers profit from buying at prices, lower than the retention value, sellers profit from selling and prices higher than the cost.
For ZI-C traders, when a losing trade is generated, such action is considered invalid and ignored, thus resticting the support of the distribution of prices to profitable trades only. ZI-U can always trade at any price.

Results

Results show that ZI-U traders do not reach price equilibrium, ZI-C traders do not reach a price equilibrium, but trade with lower volatility, while human traders do reach an equilibrium. Since ZI-C traders do not have memory, the lower volatility must be attributed only to a narrowing set of opportunities. As the market evolves higher redemption and lower cost units are bought and sold first, narrowing the allowed support of the price distributions to the traders.

Efficiency can be defined as the profits earned by all traders divided by the maximum total profits they could have earned. ZI-U traders show low levels of efficiency, while ZI-C traders reach level of efficiency, similar to human traders.
Therefore, high levels of efficiency for human traders cannot be attributed to memory or rationality.

Few conclusions are drawn:

- The absense of rationality seems to be offset by the structure of the auction market, with the rules of the market being a powerful constraining force on individual behavior. Extraction of surplus appears to be a characteristic of the environment while efforts from market participants to maximize profits seems to be not necessary.
- Profit maximization seems to be associated with lowering profit dispersion across individuals.
- The maximum possible surplus has traditionally been used as an index of rationality, and this may not be appropriate for ZI traders.
