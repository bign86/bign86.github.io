In Unix there are two commands to delete users and groups: `userdel` e `deluser`. Despite the same purpose they are quite different in their use.

## Userdel

This is ​​​​​a low-level command potentially harmful. It deletes the user from the system with all the files belonging to him.

```bash
# userdel -f user
```

The `-f` op​​​​​tion forces the removal even if the user is connected to the system. The user directory inside `/home/` and all the mails will be deleted even if another user has the files currently open.

Inside the `/etc/login.defs` file you can define

```bash
USERGROUPS_ENAB yes
```

With this option enabled the `-f` option deletes the eventual group with the same name of the user even if another user is inside that group.

## Deluser

This is a very simple command

```bash
# deluser user
```

The configuration file for this program is `/etc/deluser.conf`.
Without options the user is deleted but all files, mail and home directory remain. Many options allow to modify the command behavior. This a non-comprehensive list

| Option              | Meaning                                                                              |
|:-------------------:| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--backup`          | do a backup of all the files of the user                                             |
| `--backup-to`       | give the place to save the archive with the backup. Default is the current directory |
| `--remove-home`     | remove the user home                                                                 |
| `--remove-all-file` | remove all the user files                                                            |
| `--group`           | remove the user group                                                                |
| `--system`          | user and group are removed only if of the system                                     |
| `--conf`            | change the configuration file to use                                                 |

The command can be give as

```bash
# delgroup
```

that is an alias for

```bash
# deluser --group
```

_Note_: using the option `--force` you can remove the root (`UID 0`) account. Pay attention!
