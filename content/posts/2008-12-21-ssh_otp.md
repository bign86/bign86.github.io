One Time Passwords (OTP) are throwaway passwords that can be used nly once. They were very popular in the past before SSH and people had to login to remote servers using unprotected protocols like `rcp`, `rsh`, `rlogin`, `telnet`, exposed to Man-In-The-Middle attacks. SSH has made OTP passwords less common. However, if you need to login to a remote server from a public PC where someone can have installed a keylogger and could therefore steal a password, OTPs are still very useful.

## Configuring OTP

The most common implementation of OTP on Linux is OPIE (One Password In Everything). On Debian (and *buntu) the packages to install are

```bash
apt-get install opie-server opie-client libpam-opie
```

In order to use OPIE, create an account for your user

```bash
nero@note:~$ opiepasswd -c
Adding nero:
Only use this method from the console; NEVER from remote. If you are using
telnet, xterm, or a dial-in, type ^C now or exit with no password.
Then run opiepasswd without the -c parameter.
Using MD5 to compute responses.
Enter new secret pass phrase:
Again new secret pass phrase:

ID nero OTP key is 499 he6074
BAN RIB THEM BOIL SOY BORG
```

The creation tool asks for a secret phrase that is used to generate a seed (in the above case is he6074) and a set of 500 passwords. The last line above tells the first password of the set, the one to use the next time the user wants to login. At each successful login, the system provides the next password from the set.

The password set can be generated also from remote if necessary. In this case the procedure to follow is the same, assumed access to the server through other means (as SSH). The command is

```bash
opiepasswd -cf
```

This makes the OPT server believe the connection is secure thanks to the `-f` option.

## Setting up SSH

OTPs can be used in conjunction with SSH as well if the SSH daemon has been configured to do it. In the SSH configuration file, on Debian `/etc/pam.d/sshd` while on different distributions may be different, add the following line

```bash
auth       required     pam_opie.so
```

A `grep` on the file should return something similar to

```bash
cat /etc/pam.d/sshd | grep "auth       required"
auth       required     pam_env.so # [1]
auth       required     pam_env.so envfile=/etc/default/locale
auth       required     pam_opie.so
```

Next, modify the SSH server configuration file ()`/etc/ssh/ssh_config` on Debian) adding the following line

```bash
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
```

and reload the SSH daemon to update the configurations using

```bash
/etc/init.d/ssh reload
```

The OTP password is now "required" to login with SSH and the system will give the next OTP to use if the login is successful. Trying to access the box from remote what happens is

```bash
nero@note:~$ ssh home.server
otp-md5 498 he6074 ext, Response:
```

The system is asking for the password number 498 from the set.

## Print the passwords

The whole set of passwords is generated at the same time and stored on the system. It is always possible to print a subset of those passwords to keep somewhere. Clearly is better to print the list locally if we have physical access to the server, or through an SSH secured terminal. To print a subset of 10 passwords

```bash
nero@note:~$ opiekey -n 10 498 he6074
Using the MD5 algorithm to compute response.
Reminder: Don't use opiekey from telnet or dial-in sessions.
Enter secret pass phrase:
489: MONA CROW FAY ALL RIG HONK
490: REEK EGO SANE ON GATE POT
491: NEED SLEW CRAY AIRY VERB CUBE
492: SENT JAB SELF VIEW MATE CALF
493: FAD WINK SHY DREW HOC BANE
494: IOTA DISC WAR DOCK SALT BALM
495: SOP COAL TASK SIS HONK MARE
496: BRAN SLOW SNAG WACK CLUE LAMB
497: WED BID RED ACHE CROW FLED
498: ELK RAKE TRY BOUT NODE HUT
```

If you print them on paper _DO NOT LOOSE THE PAPER!_
