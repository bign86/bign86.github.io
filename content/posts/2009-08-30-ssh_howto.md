## Introduction

Before the Secure Shell protocol it was common to use plain text. communications as in telnet. Of course this represents a big security issue. Plain text can be easily sniffed and read due to the lack of encryption meaning that user names and password are in serious danger.\\
The Secure Shell (SSH) protocol solved the problem using an asymmetric key pair. SSH allows for secure communications, graphic remote sessions, remote command execution, and much more. SSH can handle the key exchange between client and server, authenticate users, and encrypt data. On Linux the standard implementation is OpenSSH, present by default in the repositories of every distribution.

In this howto I collected what I found useful about the installation and basic configuration of both client and server. As usual I think at this how to as a hands-on guide, not a comprehensive guide at all. OpenSSH is a very big software and the official documentation should always be read before start working with SSH especially if you are working on a server.

_NOTE_: this howto is based on Debian. While in Debian derivates all commands should be the same, in other distributions things may change. If you find that in your distribution something is different let me know, so we can improve the howto together.

## Installation

First we need to install required packages. OpenSSH should be installed by default in every distribution, but in case is not enter

```bash
apt-get install ssh
```

This Debian metapackage depends on both client and server. Search in the repos of your distribution for the right packages.\\
To install only the client (if you only need to connect to remote machines but you don't accept incoming connections) it is enough to install

```bash
apt-get install openssh-client
```

## Set up the client

We start from the setup of the client. Installing SSH should create a new directory `~/.ssh` in the user home folder. If for some reason it's not there use the following to create it

```bash
mkdir ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh
```

Now try a first connection to a remote server using the following syntax

```bash
ssh <user>@<server>
```

You will be asked for the password. of the user you are connecting with. Enter it. If it's correct a message will be prompted.

```bash
The authenticity of host 'your_server.org' can't be established.
DSA key fingerprint is 61:d3:1a:6c:5c:fa:26:2d:b0:cf:4a:03:9a:74:a5:cc.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

Reply "yes" and a shell should come up

```bash
Warning: Permanently added 'your_server.org' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
```

If you current user on the local machine and on the remote one are the same you can also use the syntax

```bash
ssh <server>
```

You can test this by connecting to your user on your local machine. In this case the actual username will be passed to the remote server.

If the connection works as expected your SSH is perfectly up and running.

### Create asymmetric key pairs

Using only a password is not a secure way to use SSH since the password can be stolen or brute forced. Using asymmetric key pairs is considered a far more secure solution. To know more about asymmetric key cryptography see for example [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography).\
Keys must first be generated with the `keygen` tool provided by SSH

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

Press Enter to save the keys to file. Now you'll be asked for the passphrase twice. Enter what you prefer. Choosing a strong one is always a good idea. If you want to change it later use the `-p` option of the keygen

```bash
ssh-keygen -p
```

`ssh-keygen` since SSH 5.7 use the recommended and default protocol to generate the key is the ECDSA. Also the RSA 1 (2048 bit), RSA 2 (4096 bit) and DSA (1024 bit) algorithms are available. To change the algorithm use the `-t` option

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa2        # or -t dsa
```

The RSA 1 protocol is old and insecure with respect to the RSA 2 while the newer ECDSA should be faster than the RSA 2 with a similar security. The only issue with ECDSA is that might be incompatible with older versions of SSH.

`ssh-keygen` generates a pair of keys, one public and one private. The private one is stored inside the `/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa` file (or another one if we didn't use the default one) and the public one is in a file with the `.pub` suffix (by default `id_rsa.pub`). The private key must be kept safe on the local machine and should never be moved or copied elsewhere for security reasons. The public key is the one that the server we want to connect to must know in order to be able to recognize us and has to be copied remotely.

More options in the man page

```bash
man ssh-keygen
```

### Copy the keys

**Traditional way**\
The public key must be copied on the remote server. Tools like `scp` are perfect for this purpose

```bash
scp /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <user>@<server>:~/
```

Some useful options of `scp`

| Option     | Meaning                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-r`       | recursive copy                                                                                           |
| `-P [num]` | port to use. Sometimes the service is not on the default port (the 22) and you need to change the number |

The public key you have copied in your home folder on the remote server must be inserted in the `.ssh/authorized_keys file`. Log in and copy the key in the file

```bash
ssh <user>@<server>
cat id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
rm id_rsa.pub
logout
```

The public key file is no longer needed and can be deleted. You can also use this one-liner to generate and copy the keys

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa2 && cat id_rsa.pub | ssh <user>@<server> $(sh -c "cat ->> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && \
              chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys")
```

**Faster way**\
Another way to copy the public key remotely is to use the `ssh-copy-id` command. Simply enter

```bash
ssh-copy-id <user>@<server>
```

The public key must be in a file called `id_rsa.pub`.

**Delete public key and check permissions**\
The public key is no longer needed both on the client and the server and should be deleted.

```bash
rm id_rsa.pub
```

**Troubleshooting**\
Check that SSH is active client side with

```bash
ps -e | grep ssh
2908 ?        00:00:00 ssh-agent
```

If it is not active start it using as root

```bash
sh /usr/bin/ssh-agent
```

If SSH refuses the connection after the setup of the key pair is complete, it might be that permissions are wrong. Check that the `authorized_key` file on the server is readable and writable only by you and that the `.ssh/` folder has no writing permissions for group and others.
For safety, permissions should look like

```bash
# On the client
drwx------   2 nero nero 4,0K apr  3  2013 .ssh/
-rw-------   1 nero nero 1,7K mar 30  2013 id_rsa
# On the server
drwx------   2 remote remote 4,0K apr  3  2013 .ssh/
-rw-------   1 remote remote  396 18 jun  2012 authorized_keys
```

## Set up the server

**Configuring the `sshd_config` file**\
Now the keys are in place but you need to tell the server to use them. On the server open the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and modify the file to have

```bash
PubkeyAuthentication yes
AuthorizedKeysFile %h/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

This option works only with SSH2. To use it with SSH1 is slightly different

```bash
RSAAuthentication yes
AuthorizedKeysFile %h/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

However SSH1 is old and unsafe and should NEVER be used.

_Note_: Keys are entered in `authorized_keys` one per line. Copying the key be sure that it not contains non-printable characters or line breaks.\
_Note 2_: Deleting a public key from the `authorized_keys` file on the server will make impossible for that user to access again.\
Now the key log in is enabled and we can log in even without the password if we want (see how to disable password access).

**Check that the SSH daemon is active**

```bash
ps -e | grep sshd
3016 ?        00:00:00 sshd
```

If it is not active start it using as root

```bash
/etc/init.d/sshd start
```

## Use of SSH

To connect from the client to the server use the following syntax

```bash
ssh -l <user> <server>
```

or

```bash
ssh <user>@<server>
```

The two commands are equivalent and will connect the client to the desired server as the desired user. The server will ask for the password if needed (see also here for connection without password). Enter the right password and you're in!

### Execute remote commands

Through SSH you can execute remote commands on the remote server with the rights of the user logged in. A shell ready to be used is prompted until you log out from the remote host. If you only want to issue one command, it is faster to log in and execute on the same instruction. SSH accept also commands as parameters of the connection using this syntax

```bash
ssh <user>@<server> $(command -options whatever)
```

To issue several commands in the same SSH call use a semicolon (`;`) to separate them. They are evaluated in the same order they are written. Be sure that commands are quoted or the semicolon will terminate the SSH call.

```bash
ssh <user>@<server> $(command1; command2; command3)
```

To log out when finished use the logout command

```bash
<user>@<server>:~$ logout
```

### Mount a remote folder with SSHFS

Thanks to SSHFS and the Fuse project, SSH is able to mount a remote folder on the local filesystem like any other partition. In this way you can work on this files securely. The connection is not incredibly fast since all communications to and from the remote filesystem are silently sent through SSH and crypted. So don't use it for heavy load operations. For more informations on the Fuse project see the official documentation at Fuse project.

Fuse is usually installed on every distribution by default. To install both Fuse and SSHFSuse (on Debian and derivates)

```bash
apt-get install sshfs fuse
```

Insert the fuse module in the kernel with

```bash
modprobe fuse
```

Now we must add to the fuse group every user we want to be able to mount remote folders

```bash
usermod -a -G fuse <user>
```

If Fuse was installed on your machine check that your user is in the fuse group.\
When Fuse is configured the user can mount a remote folder using the syntax

```bash
sshfs idmap=<user> <user>@<server>:/remote_dir ~/local_dir
```

Now the remote folder `remote_dir` is mounted locally as `local_dir` and is browsable like any other folder in the filesystem.

To unmount

```bash
fusermount -u ~/local_dir
```

It is possible to automatically mount a SSHFS partition on boot modifying the `/etc/fstab` file. Following the usual syntax of this file, the line to add is

```bash
sshfs#<user>@<server>:/path/to/remote_dir /path/to/local_dir/    fuse   defaults, idmap=user   0 0
```

### Copy files remotely

To copy some file to the remote server you can use the `scp` command, a secure version of the usual command `cp`. The syntax is the same

```bash
scp <source> <destination>
```

and can be used to transfer a file to the remote server using

```bash
scp <file> <user>@<server>:<remote_path>
```

For example

```bash
scp archive.tar user@my_server.org:/home/user/path/archive.tar
```

Also transfer from the remote folder is possible using the same syntax

```bash
scp user@my_server.org:/home/user/path/archive.tar local_archive.tar
```

## X11 forwarding

By enabling the X11 forwarding, applications that need a GUI interface can be executed remotely while the X server output gets visualized on the local machine through SSH. The `-X` option and the `-Y` option enable the X11 forwarding at the connection

```bash
ssh -X <user>@<server>
# or
ssh -Y <user>@<server>
```

On the server side the X11 forwarding is possible only if you allow for it. To make it available modify the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file so that there are this two lines

```bash
AllowTcpForwarding yes
X11Fowarding yes
```

The X11 tunnel is a potential security weakness for both client and server. If you run a server make this available only if really needed for some reason or keep it disabled explicitly with

```bash
X11Fowarding no
```

On the client side you can set up to always use the forwarding modifying the `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` file in this way

```bash
ForwardX11 yes
```

If you run a client use it only when necessary and with trusted server. It is possible for the client to choose to use or not the X11 tunnel selectively for each remote host. In the `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` file add this line

```bash
Host *.foo.com
ForwardX11 yes

Host *
ForwardX11 no
```

The X11 forwarding is disabled for all host except for the domains belonging to foo.com.

There is a subtle difference between the `-X` option and the `-Y` option used by a client connecting. The former enables the "simple" X11 forwarding, the latter a "full access" X11 forwarding. What does it mean? When the "simple" forwarding is enabled the sever will send back to the client the GUI result of any command issued to the server unless certain security rules are violated. In this case the client will receive an error. When the "full access" forwarding is used, the client has total access to the original X11 server and the X11 SECURITY extension restrictions are not imposed. For more informations about this look into the X11 SECURITY restrictions.\
To ask for a safer connection

```bash
ssh -X <user>@<server>
```

or for a full access one

```bash
ssh -Y <user>@<server>
```

There is a keyword we might want to modify on the client side (`/etc/ssh/ssh_config` configuration file). The key

```bash
ForwardX11Trusted no
```

specifies whether we want a full access connection by default. Therefore when the configuration is like

```bash
ForwardX11 no
ForwardX11Trusted no
```

we have

```bash
ssh <user>@<server> != ssh -X <user>@<server> != ssh -Y <user>@<server>
```

so that no forwarding is enabled by default. When

```bash
ForwardX11 yes
ForwardX11Trusted no
```

we have

```bash
ssh <user>@<server> == ssh -X <user>@<server> != ssh -Y <user>@<server>
```

so that forwarding is enabled but we need to explicitly ask for full access. When

```bash
ForwardX11 yes
ForwardX11Trusted yes
```

we have

```bash
ssh <user>@<server> == ssh -X <user>@<server> == ssh -Y <user>@<server>
```

so that we always have full access. At last

```bash
ForwardX11 no
ForwardX11Trusted yes
```

we have

```bash
ssh <user>@<server> != ssh -X <user>@<server> == ssh -Y <user>@<server>
```

we need to ask for the tunneling but it will always be full access.\
There is a quick way to know if the X11 tunnel is enabled. Connect to the server and check if the `DISPLAY` environment variable is set.

```bash
<user>@<server>:~$ echo $DISPLAY
localhost:10.0
```

If everything is working correctly graphical applications will be displayed on the local desktop. Speed and responsiveness of the graphical session depend mainly on the network speed. Usually any network is able to run more common applications without flaws. But if you pretend to be able to watch a BlueRay disc through SSH you may be in trouble.

Data compressions can be activated when the graphic session is too slow. Compression is triggered by the `-C` option

```bash
ssh -X -C <user>@<server>
```

Server side the compression can be enabled for by default adding the following line to the `sshd_config` file

```bash
Compression yes
```

## Settings

OpenSSH is a very big and complex program with a lot of options both client side and server side. It's clearly impossible and pointless to try to describe them all. Here there are only options and tricks I think are the most important or interesting for the majority of people.

### Client side

Settings for the client are located in the `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` file. The root permissions are needed to change the file.

#### Check IP

The SSH client checks the IP address of the server is connecting to by comparing it with the IP stored in the `.ssh/known_hosts` file. If the address has changed, SSH displays a warning message

```bash
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been changed.
```

If the source of connection is trusted go further entering "yes" and the new IP will be registered in the `known_host` in place of the old.

This feature is useful for security but can be tedious if you need to connect frequently to a server with dynamic IP. To disable it (but do it only if is important for you) open the configuration file `ssh_config` and modify it to have this line

```bash
CheckHostIP no
```

The right thing to do is to disable the check only for domains that give problems

```bash
Host *.dynamic_server.net
CheckHostIP no
```

#### Keep the connection alive (client)

If there is no traffic on the SSH tunnel for some time the connection is closed. The time interval before the connection is shut down can be modified changing these two lines

```bash
ServerAliveInterval 100
ServerAliveCountMax 3
```

The first line is the time interval in second the client waits before sending a request to the server to keep the connection alive. If the server doesn't respond, the client will continue to send messages with the same time interval. If the time is 0 the client will not send messages. After a number of messages given by the second line, the client will disconnect. If the second line is 0 the client disconnect the first time it has no response. In this example the client disconnects after 3 messages and 300 seconds if the server has disappeared.

#### Hashing the `known_hosts` file

In the `known_hosts` file the addresses and names of the various servers are stored in plain text. If you are concerned with security you can hash the whole file using the `-H` option of the utility `ssh-keygen`

```bash
ssh-keygen -H -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts
rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts.old
```

SSH will be still able to read the hashed file.

### Server side

Configurations for the server side are located in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

#### Disable password access

Use both password and key to access a remote server is the safest way. But in some cases, like non interactive logins, it is better to avoid using passwords and rely only on the key. For example when we want to automate a job on the remote using `cron` and a script. To disable password access on the server you must modify the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file.\
Before doing any change, backup the server configuration file for security

```bash
# cd /etc/ssh
# cp sshd_config sshd_config.bak
# nano sshd_config
```

and modify it to have the following lines

```bash
PasswordAuthentication no
UsePAM no
```

If a new user want to create his keys he must follow the step 3. When asked for the password press Enter and the couple of keys will be generated without password.

To make new configurations effective restart the SSH daemon

```bash
/etc/init.d/ssh restart
```

#### Not permit root login

To enhance security on the server is better to explicitly say which users can connect via SSH and which can't. The most dangerous user is of course root. Permit the root user to login means that if someone steals the password or the key, he has full access to the server system. It is always a good idea to disable the root user in this way

```bash
PermitRootLogin no
```

The root user cannot connect but it's possible to connect with another user and then obtain root permissions using `su` or `sudo`.

#### Disable an user

For the other users use the instructions AllowUsers and DenyUsers to explicitly allow or disallow a user to connect. The syntax is

```bash
AllowUsers user1 user2
DenyUsers user3 user4
```

Another possibility is to use the instructions `AllowGroups` and `DenyGroups`. These work the same way as the previous two, but as the name suggest, they work on groups. One simple way to keep things organized is to create a group on the server allowed to connect through SSH and add all the users you want to allow to that group.

```bash
# groupadd -r sshallow
# usermod -a -G sshallow user
```

Than you change the usual configuration file

```bash
AllowGroups sshallow
```

#### Timeout setting

To change the time limit available to the user to authenticate himself modify this line (in seconds)

```bash
LoginGraceTime 100
```

After 100 seconds the connection is closed by the server.

#### Keep the connection alive (server)

After some time the connection is not used, the server close it and the user must reconnect. To change the time limit

```bash
ClientAliveInterval 100
ClientAliveCountMax 3
```

Like for the client the first line is the number of seconds between connection attempts, the second is the number of attempts before closing the connection.

#### Disable empty passwords

To use empty passwords to login is dangerous for security. It is always best to disallow empty passwords with this line

```bash
PermitEmptyPasswords no
```

However there are tools like `scp` that may need this option set on "yes". Check your own needs and if you can set it on "no".

#### Change service port

The default port for SSH is the 22. Needless to say that all the bots on the net try to attack this port. If you have a firewall the very big part of those attacks are harmless but anyway they fill up quickly the log files. To avoid the annoyance, change the service port to one bigger than 1024 with the following line

```bash
Port 1234
```

Remember that suitable ports are between 1025 and 65535. But you may experience problems going over 5000. If you want to change the port only for this time, launch the SSH daemon on the server with the option `-p <port>`

```bash
# sshd -p <port>
```

#### Check user files permissions

A user should not keep files in his home directory with permissions like `777` for security reasons. To avoid the problem make sure to have the following line in the configuration file

```bash
StrictMode yes
```

#### Restrict the sources of connection

SSH by default accepts connections from all over the world and checks for keys and/or password matching to allow logging in. If you know that connections for a certain user should come only from a certain IP or range of IPs you can deny connections for that user coming from other IPs. To do that use the field `from=""` in the `authorized_keys` file. In this field write a list of domains or IP addresses accepted for that key. This field will be checked by the daemon in addition to key and password.

```bash
from="86.101.12.[0-9],*.foo.org"
```

In this field you can also explicitly deny connections from a source using the character `!`.

```bash
from="goodserver.com,!*.badserver.net"
```

The `from=""` field has other options that I omit. Read the `sshd` man page for more.

#### Add a banner

When a user connects to the server the shell prompt is displayed. However it is possible to display a banner or a message anytime a user connects before the shell prompt adding it to a file and using the following line in the configuration file

```bash
Banner /path/to/banner/file
```

#### Change the number of bits of the key

The bit number of the key is adjustable in the configuration file using this keyword

```bash
ServerKeyBits 1024
```

When creating the key tell to `ssh-keygen` the number of bits to be used with the `-b` option

```bash
ssh-keygen -t dsa -b 2048
```

#### Change server listening addresses

SSH by default listens for connections on any IP address (it is set on 0.0.0.0) belonging to the server. When your server has more than one IP address associated you may want the server to listen only on one of them. To bind the server socket to one IP address use the following keyword

```bash
ListenAddress 192.168.10.98
```

#### Change the host key file

Private keys on the server are kept in the ssh_host_key file for protocol SSH-1 and in the `ssh_host_rsa_key`, `ssh_host_dsa_key`, and `ssh_ecdsa_host_key` files for the protocol SSH-2 (the file is choose on the base of the type of key). To override the default file use the `HostKey` key in the configuration file

```bash
HostKey /etc/ssh/my_host_key      // SSH-1
HostKey /etc/ssh/my_host_dsa_key  // SSH-2
```

#### Check the correctness of `sshd_config`

To check for the sanity of the `sshd_config` file there is the `-t` option whose purpose is to read all the keys and see if they are valid. Then the daemon exit and the exit code should be 0. To check use:

```bash
sshd -t
echo $?
```

## The Control Master

The Control Master allows to open more than one session at a time on the same connection. With the first session a socket is created. New connections to the same host will use the same master connection without renegotiating. The socket is specified with the `ControlPath` keyword. Control Master enable autocompletion for the shell and speed up file transfer.

To activate it add the following lines in the `ssh_config` file on the client

```bash
ControlPath ~/.ssh/socket/master-%r@%h:%p
ControlMaster auto
```

In auto mode the CM will use the existing socket if present. If not it will create a new one.

The CM has many options you can use with the syntax `ControlMaster <flag>`. The list in the table.

| Option    | Meaning                                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `no`      | do not be CM but use an existing socket if present |
| `yes`     | always be the CM                                   |
| `ask`     | if a socket exist, ask to the user to use it       |
| `askauto` | a combination of auto and ask                      |

With the option `-M` connecting to SSH you are giving to that session the Control Master status. The first line is the path of the socket to create with it's name. Every socket is identified univocally with is name.

| Option | Meaning          |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| `%r`   | login user       |
| `%h`   | remote host name |
| `%p`   | port number      |
| `%l`   | local host name  |

### Persistent connection

This option is useful when we log in frequently for short sessions. Using the persistent connection, when you log in the connection remains open in background as a CM. Every other connection made as the same user will use the CM running in background instead of open a new session.

```bash
ssh -MNf user@remote_host.org
```

## Conclusions

In this howto only a very small part of OpenSSH is presented. The whole program is too wide to be reviewed in a howto. Informations presented here come from (mainly) the official documentation distributed on line and with the man pages of OpenSSH. I suggest to read carefully the man pages especially if you are planning to set up a server of your own.

```bash
man ssh
man sshd
man ssh_config
man sshd_config
man ssh-keygen
```

Check the SSH daemon is active on the server

$ ps -e | grep sshd
3016 ?        00:00:00 sshd

or that the client is active client side

$ ps -e | grep ssh
2908 ?        00:00:00 ssh-agent

If are not active start them using as root one of the following

* `sh /usr/bin/ssh-agent     // for the client`
* `/etc/init.d/sshd start    // for the server`
