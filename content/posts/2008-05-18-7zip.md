The `.7z` extension is used for archives produced by the 7-Zip archiver program. Its distinctive feature is to use the LZMA compression algorithm that guarantees a compression ratio generally 30-50% better than the ZIP algorithm. Nevertheless, many archiver do not read the 7z format, probably due to its scarce diffusion, and `tar` is not an exception.

To create and read a 7z archives there are specific packages for each distribution. In Debian the package name is p7zip, and the metapackage p7zip-full adds the integration in File Roller and other GUIs. The package p7zip-rar provides a module for 7-Zip to unpack RAR files. In other distributions the packages names may change.

To extract a 7-Zip archive in the current directory use the `-x` option

```bash
p7zip -x path/to/file.7z
```

while the `-l` option lists the package content

```bash
p7zip -l path/to/file.7z
```

The 7z format is _not_ suited for backups. This is because the 7z format does not retain the information on file owners, groups and permissions. To take advantage of the 7z compression ratio for backups, first create an archive using `tar`, and then compress it with the 7z algorithm. In this way all attributes of original files are kept.

```bash
tar -cvf file.tar folder/* && 7zip -a file.tar.7z file.tar && rm file.tar
```

This one-liner creates the RAR archive and compresses it with 7z.
