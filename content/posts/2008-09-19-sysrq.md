The SysRq is a combination of keys read directly by the kernel to recover the system from a complete freeze. It does always work unless a kernel panic happened. There are few variations of magic keys combinations

```bash
Alt + PrintScreen + KEY
```

where `KEY` depends on the action to perform. In order to be able to use the SysRq keys, the kernel must have been compiled with the flag

```bash
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ
```

enabled. Any major distribution should have enabled SysRq by default but to check use

```bash
grep CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ /boot/config-$(uname -r)
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ=y
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ_DEFAULT_ENABLE=0x01b6
```

the line `CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ=y` indicates that SysRq is enabled. In any case, SysRq can be quickly enabled/disabled at will modifying `/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq`

```bash
cat /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
438
```

The number in explains which combinations of magic keys are enabled, with 0 meaning that SysRq is not enabled. To understand which combinations are enabled use the following table (from the official documentation)

| Flag | Bitmask     | Meaning                                                    |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    |             | disable SysRq completely                                   |
| 1    |             | enable all functions of SysRq                              |
| >1   |             | bitmask of allowed SysRq functions                         |
|      | 2 = 0x2     | enable control of console logging level                    |
|      | 4 = 0x4     | enable control of keyboard (SAK, unraw)                    |
|      | 8 = 0x8     | enable debugging dumps of processes etc.                   |
|      | 16 = 0x10   | enable `sync` command                                      |
|      | 32 = 0x20   | enable remount read-only                                   |
|      | 64 = 0x40   | enable signaling of processes (`term`, `kill`, `oom-kill`) |
|      | 128 = 0x80  | allow reboot/poweroff                                      |
|      | 256 = 0x100 | allow change nice of all RT tasks                          |

In Debian the bitmask 438 corresponds to

```bash
438 = 2 + 4 + 16 + 32 + 128 + 256
```

Note that the value 438 in hexadecimal corresponds to 0x01b6 as found in

```bash
grep CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ_DEFAULT_ENABLE /boot/config-$(uname -r)
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ_DEFAULT_ENABLE=0x01b6
```

Modifying this key at kernel compilation time will change the default SysRq combinations enabled. The default flag can be temporarilz changed on a live system using

```bash
echo "1" > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
```

or

```bash
sysctl -w kernel.sysrq=0
```

To make the change permanent the file `/etc/sysctl.conf` must be modified. In this file, search for the key `kernel.sysrq` or create it if it doesn't exist. For example, to enable SysRq

```bash
kernel.sysrq = 1
```
