The SysRq are magic keys that can be used to recover the system from a complete freeze. These combinations of keys are read directly by the kernel that will always respond unless a kernel panic happened. The magic keys combinations are all of the kind

```bash
Alt + PrintScreen + KEY
```

where `KEY` changes with the action we want to perform. In order to be able to use the SysRq keys the kernel must have been compiled with the flag

```bash
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ
```

enabled. Any major distribution enables SysRq by default but in order to whether this is true use

```bash
~$ grep CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ /boot/config-$(uname -r)
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ=y
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ_DEFAULT_ENABLE=0x01b6
```

the relevant lines is the first that indicates that the flag has been enabled. If it is the SysRq can be enabled/disabled at will in the system quickly modifying the `/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq`

```bash
~$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
438
```

The number in this file explain which combinations are available, a 0 means that SysRq is not enabled. The enabled combinations can be desumed from the following table (from the official documentation)

| Flag | Bitmask     | Meaning                                                    |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    |             | disable sysrq completely                                   |
| 1    |             | enable all functions of sysrq                              |
| >1   |             | bitmask of allowed sysrq functions                         |
|      | 2 = 0x2     | enable control of console logging level                    |
|      | 4 = 0x4     | enable control of keyboard (SAK, unraw)                    |
|      | 8 = 0x8     | enable debugging dumps of processes etc.                   |
|      | 16 = 0x10   | enable `sync` command                                      |
|      | 32 = 0x20   | enable remount read-only                                   |
|      | 64 = 0x40   | enable signaling of processes (`term`, `kill`, `oom-kill`) |
|      | 128 = 0x80  | allow reboot/poweroff                                      |
|      | 256 = 0x100 | allow change nice of all RT tasks                          |

Under Debian the bitmask 438 corresponds to

```bash
438 = 2 + 4 + 16 + 32 + 128 + 256
```

Note that the value 438 in hexadecimal corresponds to 0x01b6 as found in

```bash
~$ grep CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ_DEFAULT_ENABLE /boot/config-$(uname -r)
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ_DEFAULT_ENABLE=0x01b6
```

Modifying this key at kernel compilation time will change the default SysRq combinations enabled. The default flag can be changed on a live system using

```bash
~# echo "1" > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
```

or

```bash
~# sysctl -w kernel.sysrq=0
```

While to make the change permanent it must be modified the file `/etc/sysctl.conf`. In this file we must search for the key `kernel.sysrq` or create it if it doesn't exist, like in the following case

```bash
kernel.sysrq = 1
```

Which commands are available? The documentation page lists all the available commands. The most used ones are the following:

| Flag | Meaning                                                                 |
|:----:| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| b    | immediately reboots the system without syncing or unmounting your disks |
| e    | sends a `SIGTERM` to all processes, except for init                     |
| f    | calls `oom_kill` to kill a memory hog process                           |
| i    | sends a `SIGKILL` to all processes, except for init                     |
| o    | shuts your system off (if configured and supported)                     |
| s    | attempts to sync all mounted filesystems                                |
| t    | dumps a list of current tasks and their information to your console     |
| u    | attempts to remount all mounted filesystems read-only                   |
