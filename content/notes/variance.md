The **Variance \(\text{Var}[X],\:\sigma^2\)** is the first _raw_ moment and a generalization of the weighted average. Is the mean of the possible values of the random variable \(X\). Note that the expected value may not be one possible outcome from the sample space. It is not therefore, the value one would "expect" to obtain from a trial in the strict sense.
